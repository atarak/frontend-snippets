## CSS Battles
CSS Battles hosts a series of challenges for developers to re-create small images using only HTML and CSS. The results are scored based on 2 criteria: how closely the result matches the expected image and how many characters of code were involved. Closer matches and smaller code submissions generate higher scores. Check out the official site: https://cssbattle.dev/!
