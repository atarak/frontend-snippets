## CSS Battles
CSS Battles hosts a series of challenges for developers to re-create small images using only HTML and CSS. The results are scored based on 2 criteria: how closely the result matches the expected image and how many characters of code were involved. Closer matches and smaller code submissions generate higher scores. Check out the official site: https://cssbattle.dev/!

## Individual Components
Following various youtube tutorials or dribble inspirations, I've re-created individual web page components (buttons, grid layouts, section titles, etc).

## Frontend Mentor Challenges
Frontend Mentor provides a series of challenges for web developers to re-create web page components (product card previews, landing pages, forms, etc) that require HTML, CSS, and JS. Unlike CSS Battles, there is not an explicit scoring mechanism; the emphasis is on working through a project and soliciting feedback from the community. Once a developer has submitted their work for a challenge, he or she can view other developers' solutions and have discussions with others about how to improve.
